# TFG-CellularAutomata

`Cellular Automata Properties Prediction` is a Final Degree Project
developed by Ezequiel Gonz√°lez for his 22-23 last year in ETSII college of Seville, Spain.

It lets you generate different types of datasets based on 3 rule types.
With those you can:

- Generate interesting plots based mainly in their density evolution over time.
- Plot individual estates.
- Train, evaluate and test Machine Learning models to predict new data.
- Compare those models performance with plots.

## Main Workflow

The main idea is to provide an easy to use library to make this process as automated as possible.

First you define the CA based on certain attributes like initial state, size, rules etc. Those 3 rules can be also easy extended. This is made in the package `CA`.

Then you can build the dataset with this new CA and the free parameters. Those datasets are stored in `data/datasets`. This is made in package `datasets`.

Now, with the new built dataset, you can start analyzing it via the multiple plots that are available in the package `statistics`.

Finally, you can train, evaluate and test Machine Learning models to predict new data. This is made in the package `learning`.

# Getting started

## Requirements

- Python 3.10.7
- pipenv (2022.10.11) for virtual environment management

## Setup

First clone the repository from Github:
```
git clone https://github.com/ezegonmac/TFG-CellularAutomata
```

Create a virtual environment:
```
cd TFG-CellularAutomata
pipenv shell
```

Install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The main package is `src`. It contains the following principal subpackages:

- `CA`: Contains the CA class and the 3 rule types.
- `datasets`: Contains the definition of datasets and the functions to build them.
- `statistics`: Contains the functions to generate statistical plots of the datasets.
- `learning`: Contains the functions to train, evaluate and test Machine Learning models.

Their functions must be called from their specific `main` files. Those files are located in the `src` folder.

Those main files are:

- `main_datasets.py`: Main functions for generating the default datasets.
- `main_density_datasets.py`: Main functions for generating the density datasets.
- `main_density_plots.py`: Main functions for generating the density plots.
- `main_doc`: Main functions for generating the documentation figures.
- `main_learning.py`: Main functions for managing the learning process.
- `main_states.py`: Main functions for generating states plots.

Now you can comment/uncomment the functions you want to run in those files, or create your own functions.
You can run those files from the `src` folder with the following command:
```
python src/main_file.py
```

If you dont have your virtual environment activated, you should run the following command first:
```
pipenv shell
```
